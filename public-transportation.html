        <h1>Public transportation</h1>
        <p>Public transportation in Porto is well-developed, efficient, and affordable, making it easy for both locals and tourists to get around the city.</p>
        <h4>Here's an overview of the main transportation options:</h4>
           <div class="transport-type">
               <h4>1. Metro</h4>
               <p>Porto's metro system has 6 lines (A to F) that cover a wide area, including the city center, suburbs, and even towns like Vila Nova de Gaia and Matosinhos. It's a light-rail system that operates both underground and above ground.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li class="content-list-item">Operating Hours: Metro services run from around 6:00 AM to 1:00 AM daily.</li>
                  <li class="content-list-item">Tickets: You need to purchase an Andante Card, a reusable card that can be topped up with credit for single rides or travel passes (e.g., daily passes). Fares depend on the number of zones traveled.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="transport-type">
                <h4>2. Buses</h4>
                <p>The main bus company in Porto is <a href="https://www.stcp.pt/en/travel/" target="_blank">STCP (Sociedade de Transportes Colectivos do Porto)</a>, which operates an extensive network covering the city and surrounding areas.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="content-list-item">Operating Hours: Buses generally run from early morning until late evening, with some lines offering night service.</li>
                  <li class="content-list-item">Tickets: The Andante Card is also valid on buses. You can buy single tickets directly from the driver, but it's cheaper to use the Andante Card.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="transport-type">
                <h4>3. Trams (Elétricos)</h4>
                <p>Porto's iconic <a href="https://www.stcp.pt/en/tourism/porto-tram-city-tour/" target="_blank">heritage trams</a> are a nostalgic way to explore the city. There are two tram lines currently in operation. Line 1 runs along the Douro River from Infante to Passeio Alegre and Line 18 connects Carmo to Foz do Douro.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="content-list-item">Operating Hours Tram line 1 operates from 9 AM to 8 PM, while tram line 18 runs between 10 AM and 7 PM.</li>
                  <li class="content-list-item">Tickets: Tram tickets are purchased onboard, and the Andante Card is not valid on heritage tram services.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="transport-type">
                <h4>4. Funicular dos Guindais</h4>
                <p>This funicular connects the riverside (Ribeira) to Batalha at the top of the hill, offering spectacular views of the Douro River and the Dom Luís I Bridge.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="content-list-item">Tickets: The Andante Card is valid, or you can buy single tickets at the station.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="transport-type">
                <h4>5. Cable Car (Teleférico de Gaia)</h4>
                <p>Located on the southern bank of the Douro River in Vila Nova de Gaia, the cable car offers panoramic views of Porto and the wine cellars below. It runs from the upper level of the Dom Luís I Bridge down to the riverside in Gaia.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="content-list-item">Tickets: Separate tickets are required, not covered by the Andante Card.</li>
